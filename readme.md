!!! note
    You are viewing the documentation for VIC-WUR. VIC-WUR extends the VIC model with several modules to simulate the human impact on global water resources and crop growth (using WOFOST). Only VIC-WUR described here, for further descriptions of VIC you are referred to the [VIC github page of UW-Hydro](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC)
    
VIC-WUR is a macroscale hydrologic model that simulates the human impact on global water resources and crop growth (using WOFOST). VIC-WUR is based on VIC-5, which solves full water and energy balances. 

VIC-WUR is a research model and has been applied globally. The VIC model is distributed under the [GNU GPL v2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) license. If you make use of this model, please acknowledge the appropriate references listed on the [VIC-WUR documentation website](http://vicwur.readthedocs.org).

Development and maintenance of the current official version of the VIC-WUR model is led by the [Water Systems and Global Change group | Departement of Environmental sciences | Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Water-Systems-and-Global-Change-Group.htm). Every new application addresses new problems and conditions that the model may not currently be able to handle, and as such the model is always under development. The VIC-WUR model is an open source development project, which means that contributions are welcome, including to the VIC-WUR documentation.

All development activity is coordinated via the [VIC-WUR github page](https://github.com/wur-wsg/VIC), where you can also find all archived, current, beta, and development versions of the model.
