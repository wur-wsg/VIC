# Water-use Model Parameters

!!! Note
	It is the user's responsibility to ensure that parameter files are formatted appropriately.


The Water-use Parameters serve three main purposes:

*   Define the cell ID number of each grid cell. This ID number is used to identify receiving cells.
*   Define the receiving cells. (use in remote water withdrawals)

The water-use parameters are supplied to VIC-WUR in a NetCDF file, with a separate variable for each water-use parameter.

Below is a list of water-use parameters.

| Variable Name | Dimension                | Units | Type | Number of Values        | Description                 |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| receiving_id  | [lat, lon]               | N/A   | int  | 1                       | Current cell grid cell ID   |
| Nreceiving    | [lat, lon]               | N/A   | int  | 1                       | Number of receiving cells   |
| receiving     | [wu_receiving, lat, lon] | N/A   | int  | water-use max receiving | Receiving cell grid cell ID |
