# Model Development

There are currently a number of active development projects working on VIC-WUR. We encourage any users who have modified (or would like to modify) VIC-WUR, either to fix bugs or develop new features, to contact us and coordinate development work with us. If you are a VIC-WUR user and have found a bug or have improved your private version of VIC-WUR in some way, please let us know by submitting an issue at the [VIC-WUR GitHub Page](https://github.com/wur-wsg/VIC).

## Release Naming Convention

Beginning with the release of VIC 4.2, a release naming convention of VIC.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH has been formally adopted. This naming system was introduced by [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and defined as:

1.  MAJOR version: when changes are included that are not backward compatible,
2.  MINOR version: when features and new functionality are added in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3.  PATCH version: when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.
